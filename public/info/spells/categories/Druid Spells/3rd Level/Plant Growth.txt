Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.
If you cast this spell using 1action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4feet of movement for every 1foot it moves.
You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.
If you cast this spell over 8hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
