Death Ward
4th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 8hours
You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.
The first time the target would drop to 0hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1hit point, and the spell ends.
If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.
