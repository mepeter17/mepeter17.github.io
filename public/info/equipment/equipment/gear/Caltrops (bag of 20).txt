Item: Caltrops (bag of 20) 
Cost: 1 gp 
Weight: 2 lb. 
Description: As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.
