Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world. Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power.
