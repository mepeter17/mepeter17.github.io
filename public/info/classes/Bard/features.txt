-S p e l l c a s t i n g
You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of
reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your
spells are part o f your vast repertoire, magic that you
can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the
general rules o f spellcasting and chapter 11 for the
bard spell list.
-C a n t r i p s
You know two cantrips o f your choice from the bard
spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips o f your
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
column o f the Bard table.
-Sp e l l Sl o t s
The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell's level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure
wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.
-Sp e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard
spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you
pour into the performance o f your music or oration.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
-R i t u a l C a s t i n g
You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that
spell has the ritual tag.
-Sp e l l c a s t in g Fo c u s
You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5)
as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
-B a r d i c I n s p i r a t i o n
You can inspire others through stirring w ords or music.
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose
one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you
who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic
Inspiration die, a d6.
Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll
the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can
wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the
Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM
says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic
Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have
only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
You can use this feature a number o f times equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum o f once). You
regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach
certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th
level, a d 10 at 10th level, and a d l2 at 15th level.
-J a c k O f A l l T r a d e s
Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency
bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that
doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
-S o n g O f R e s t
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or
oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during
a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures w ho can
hear your performance regain hit points at the end of
the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra
1d6 hit points.
The extra hit points increase when you reach certain
levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d 10 at 13th
level, and to 1d 12 at 17th level.
-B a r d C o l l e g e
At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of
a bard college o f your choice: the College o f Lore or the
College o f Valor, both detailed at the end o f the class
description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level
and again at 6th and 14th level.
-E x p e r t i s e
At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
make that uses either o f the chosen proficiencies.
At 10th level, you can choose another two skill
proficiencies to gain this benefit.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability s cores o f
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
-F o n t O f I n s p i r a t i o n
Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of
your expended uses o f Bardic Inspiration when you
finish a short or long rest.
-C o u n t e r c h a r m
At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or
words o f power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As
an action, you can start a performance that lasts until
the end o f your next turn. During that time, you and any
friendly creatures within 30 feet o f you have advantage
on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.
The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or
silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
-M a g i c a l S e c r e t s
By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge
from a w ide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells
from any class, including this one. A spell you choose
must be o f a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip.
The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are
included in the number in the Spells Known column of
the Bard table.
You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th
level and again at 18th level.
-S u p e r i o r I n s p i r a t i o n
At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses
o f Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
-C o l l e g e O f L o r e
Bards o f the College o f Lore know something about
most things, collecting bits o f knowledge from sources
as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales.
Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts
to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies
down, the audience members might find themselves
questioning everything they held to be true, from their
faith in the priesthood o f the local temple to their
loyalty to the king.
The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit o f beauty
and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the
tenets o f a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a
herald or advisor knows that the bard w ould rather be
honest than politic.
The college's members gather in libraries and
sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms
and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.
They also meet at festivals or affairs o f state, where they
can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at selfimportant
figures o f authority.
-B o n u s P r o f i c ie n c ie s
When you join the College o f Lore at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency with three skills o f your choice.
-C u t t i n g W o r d s
Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to
distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and
competence o f others. When a creature that you can
see within 60 feet o f you makes an attack roll, an ability
check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to
expend one o f your uses o f Bardic Inspiration, rolling
a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number
rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use
this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before
the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability
check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its
damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if
it's immune to being charmed.
-A d d i t i o n a l M a g i c a l Se c r e t s
At 6th level, you learn two spells o f your choice from any
class. A spell you choose must be o f a level you can cast,
as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen
spells count as bard spells for you but don't count
against the number o f bard spells you know.
-P e e r l e s s Sk i l l
Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check,
you can expend one use o f Bardic Inspiration. Roll a
Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to
your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roil
the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you
whether you succeed or fail.
-C o l l e g e O f V a l o r
Bards o f the College o f Valor are daring skalds whose
tales keep alive the memory o f the great heroes of the
past, and thereby inspire a new generation o f heroes.
These bards gather in mead halls or around great
bonfires to sing the deeds o f the mighty, both past
and present. They travel the land to witness great
events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of
those events doesn't pass from the world. With their
songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of
accomplishment as the heroes o f old.
-B o n u s P r o f ic ie n c ie s
When you join the College o f Valor at 3rd level, you
gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and
martial weapons.
-C o m b a t I n s p i r a t io n
Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle.
A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you
can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon
damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack
roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction
to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number
rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll
but before knowing whether it hits or misses.
-Ex t r a A t t a c k
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
-B a t t l e M a g ic
At 14th level, you have mastered the art o f weaving
spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious
act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you
can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
