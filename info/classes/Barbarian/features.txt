In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
aren't w earing heavy armor:.
 - You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
saving throws.
 - When you make a melee weapon attack using
Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown
in the Rage Damage column o f the Barbarian table.
 - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or
concentrate on them while raging.
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
on your turn as a bonus action.
Once you have raged the number o f times shown
for your barbarian level in the Rages column o f the
Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
can rage again.
-U n a r m o r e d D e f e n s e
While you are not w earing any armor, your Armor Class
equals 10 + your Dexterity m odifier + your Constitution
modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
-R e c k l e s s A t t a c k
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When
you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on
melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
your next turn.
-D a n g e r S e n s e
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense o f when things
nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge
when you dodge away from danger.
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.
To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or
incapacitated.
-P r i m a l Pa t h
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of
your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path
o f the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end o f the
class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that
it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you
choose to end it.
-I n d o m i t a b l e M i g h t
Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength
check is less than your Strength score, you can use that
score in place o f the total.
-P r i m a l C h a m p i o n
At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your
Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your
maximum for those scores is now 24.
-A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
-E x t r a A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
-Fa s t M o v e m e n t
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet
while you aren't w earing heavy armor.
-F e r a l I n s t i n c t
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have
advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of
combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally
on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before
doing anything else on that turn.
-B r u t a l C r i t i c a l
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional
weapon damage die when determining the extra
damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
This increases to two additional dice at 13th level
and three additional dice at 17th level.
-R e l e n t l e s s R a g e
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting
despite grievous w ounds. If you drop to 0 hit points
while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you
drop to 1 hit point instead.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC
increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the
DC resets to 10.
-Pa t h O f T h e B e r s e r k e r
For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end-—that
end being violence. The Path o f the Berserker is a path
of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter
the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos o f battle,
heedless o f your own health or well-being.
-F r e n z y
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you
can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for
the duration o f your rage you can make a single melee
weapon attack as a bonus action on each o f your turns
after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level
o f exhaustion (as described in appendix A).
-M in d l e s s R a g e
Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or
frightened while raging. If you are charmed or
frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
suspended for the duration o f the rage.
-I n t im i d a t i n g P r e s e n c e
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to
frighten someone with your menacing presence.
When you do so, choose one creature that you can see
within 30 feet o f you. If the creature can see or hear
you, it must succeed on a W isdom saving throw (DC
equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier) or be frightened o f you until the end o f your
next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action
to extend the duration o f this effect on the frightened
-P e r s i s t e n t R a g e
creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends
if the creature ends its turn out o f line o f sight or more
than 60 feet away from you.
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't
use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
-R e t a l i a t i o n
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from
a creature that is within 5 feet o f you. you can use
your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against
that creature.
-Pa t h O f T h e T o t e m W a r r i o r
The Path o f the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as
the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector,
and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you
with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your
barbarian rage.
Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be
kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for
an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,
though exceptions exist.
-Sp i r i t Se e k e r
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural
world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when
you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast
sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,
as described in chapter 10.
-T o t e m Sp i r i t
At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a
totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or
acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar
adornment-that incorporates fur or feathers, claws,
teeth, or b ones o f the totem animal. At your option, you
also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent
o f your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear
totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thickskinned,
or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn
bright yellow.
Your totem animal might be an animal related to those
listed here but more appropriate to your homeland.
For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in
place o f an eagle.
Bear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage
except psychic damage. The spirit o f the bear makes you
tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
Eagle. While you're raging and aren't wearing
heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on
opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the
Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit
of the eagle makes you into a predator w ho can weave
through the fray with ease.
Wolf, While you're raging, your friends have
advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature
within 5 feet o f you that is hostile to you. The spirit of
the wolf makes you a leader o f hunters.
-A s p e c t O f T h e B e a s t
At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the
totem animal o f your choice. You can choose the same
animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
Bear. You gain the might o f a bear. Your carrying
capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift)
is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks
made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
Eagle. You gain the eyesight o f an eagle. You can
see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern
even fine details as though looking at something no
more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim
light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom
(Perception) checks.
Wolf, You gain the hunting sensibilities o f a wolf. You
can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace,
and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal
pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).
-Sp i r i t W a l k e r
At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature
spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual
version o f one o f the animals you chose for Totem Spirit
or Aspect o f the Beast appears to you to convey the
information you seek.
-T o t e m i c A t t u n e m e n t
At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a
totem animal o f your choice. You can choose the same
animal you selected previously or a different one.
Bear, While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet
o f you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack
rolls against targets other than you or another character
with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it
can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.
Eagle. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to
your current walking speed. This benefit works only in
short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and
nothing else is holding you aloft.
Wolf. While you're raging, you can use a bonus action
on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone
when you hit it with melee w eapon attack.
