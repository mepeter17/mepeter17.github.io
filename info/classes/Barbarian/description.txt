A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard,
draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he
charges toward the frost giant w ho dared poach his
people's elk herd.
A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her
authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck
with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into
the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored
elbow into the gut o f another.
These barbarians, different as they might be, are
defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and
unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger
is the ferocity o f a cornered predator, the unrelenting
assault o f a storm, the churning turmoil o f the sea.
For some, their rage springs from a communion
with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling
reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every
barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle
frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and
feats o f strength.

People o f towns and cities take pride in how their
civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if
denying one's own nature was a mark o f superiority. To
a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign
o f weakness. The strong embrace their animal naturekeen
instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage.
Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls
and crowds. They thrive in the wilds o f their homelands:
the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes
live and hunt.
Barbarians come alive in the chaos o f combat.
They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,
giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A
barbarian can draw on this reservoir o f fury only a few
times without resting, but those few rages are usually
sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

Not every m ember o f the tribes deemed "barbarians"
by scions o f civilized society has the barbarian class. A
true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as
a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar
role as a protector o f the people and a leader in times
of war. Life in the w ild places o f the w orld is fraught
with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying
monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger
so that their people don't have to.
Their courage in the face o f danger makes barbarians
perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a
way o f life for their native tribes, and the rootless life o f
the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some
barbarians miss the close-knit family structures o f the
tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds
formed among the members of their adventuring parties.
