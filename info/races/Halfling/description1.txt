The comforts of home are the goals of most halfllings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; ablazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Halflings usually set out on the adventurer's path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world.
