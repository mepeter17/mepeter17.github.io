decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders.
Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature.
Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on.
The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
